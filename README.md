# Metro build style
An urban-themed build style for Minecolonies/Structurize, inspired by New York City.

## Description
Metro is meant to replicate the look and layout of a city, using New York City as an inspiration. Parts are built to fit within a chunk (or a portion of a chunk) and to fit together. It's recommended to show chunk outlines with `F3+g` while placing structures with the Metro style for ease of lining them up.

Buildings are built on 2x3-chunk city blocks, with 1-chunk streets connecting them. Streets consist of two sidewalks with the "street" section inbetween, and come in straight, corner, t-intersection, and intersection versions. Schematics are built at first with primitive materials like wood and (cobble)stone. Most buildings start at level 1 as single-story buildings, and add additional floors with each level they are upgraded to. They will also take on a more sophisticated, modern look with each upgrade.

## Instructions
To install the Metro build style, copy the included `metro` folder into your `<Minecraft Directory>/structurize/schematics` folder. Metro build components will then appear alongside other sets when using the build tool.
